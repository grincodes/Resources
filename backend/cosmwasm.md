# Cosmos Ecosystem
Cosmos was designed to be an ecosystem of interoperable blockchains
that exchange information and tokens between each other in a permisionless manner. 

It is made up of a decentralized network of independent blockchains
that can communicate with each other through the Inter-BlockChain Communication Protocol (IBC). 

These independents blockcahians are built on the Cosmos Sdk and there
are quite a number of them already.

**_Note:_**
DApps are not directly deployed on the Cosmos Network  but on the independent blockchains on Cosmos.


## CosmWasm 
is a  smart contracting platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem
once you have a CosmWasm-enabled blockchain you can deploy a custom contract.Cosmwasm is Rust focused so you need to know Rust before
you can write any smart contracts.
